# Explore unlimited possibilites

This is part of a [series of articles](https://github.com/PLCnext/docker_gettingstarted) that demonstrate how to install a Docker and Balena Engine on plcnext controller and start the Docker Container. Each article builds on tasks that were completed in earlier articles, so it is recommended to follow the series in sequence.

This article contains some ideas for additional features that could be added to a PLCnext Docker application. Some of these can be implemented using patterns demonstrated in this series of articles. Others will be the subject of future articles in the PLCnext Community.

## 1. Data exchange between applications within a container via API

## 2. Data exchange between application running in different Containers via IP-Socket
